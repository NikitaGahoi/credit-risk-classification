# Credit-risk-classification
## Overview of the Analysis
This comprehensive analysis was focused on addressing the critical task of credit risk classification by leveraging machine learning models. The overarching objective was to create and evaluate models capable of determining the creditworthiness of borrowers using a dataset containing historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The primary aim was to predict loan status, with '0' representing healthy loans and '1' indicating high-risk loans. This analysis entailed the utilization of various financial features, including loan size, interest rate, borrower income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, derogatory marks, and total debt.

The analysis unfolded through several pivotal stages:

- Data Preprocessing: Our initial steps involved the meticulous cleaning and organization of the raw data, ensuring it was in a suitable format for machine learning model training.

- Model Training: Machine learning models were introduced to identify patterns within the dataset. The models served as the predictive tools to distinguish between healthy and high-risk loans.

- Model Validation and Evaluation: The performance of the machine learning models was rigorously assessed, emphasizing the metrics of accuracy, precision, and recall.

- To cope with the class imbalance in the dataset, two distinct machine learning models were employed: Logistic Regression and RandomOverSampler.
